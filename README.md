Chapter 1:
6 main reasons that people choose to use python:
- software quality
- developer productivity
- program portability
- support libraries
- component intergration
- enjoyment
4 notable companies use python:
- google
- dropbox
- youtube
- BitTorrent
Why might you not want to use Python in an application?
- execution speed may not always be as fast as that of fully compiled and lower-level
languages such as C and C++
What can you do with Python?
- game programming
- Serial port communication on Windows, Linux
- image processing
- Robot control
- Natural language analysis
- Mobile computing with ports of Python to the Google Android and Apple iOS
platforms
- Mobile computing with ports of Python to the Google Android and Apple iOS
platforms
- Excel spreadsheet function and macro programming with the PyXLL or DataNitro add-ins
- Media file content and metadata tag processing with PyMedia, ID3, PIL/Pillow,
and more
- JSON and CSV file processing with the json and csv modules
- XML parsing with the xml library package, the xmlrpclib module, and third-party
extensions
- Data mining with the Orange framework, the Pattern bundle, Scrapy, and custom
code
4 way to run script file:
- command line
- import module
- exec file
- file icon click
why might you need  to reload a module:
- because python imports a module only once per process
What is a namespace, and how does it relate to module files?
- A namespace is just a package of variables (i.e., names). It takes the form of an
object with attributes in Python. Each module file is automatically a namespaceâ€”
that is, a package of variables reflecting the assignments made at the top level of
the file. Namespaces help avoid name collisions in Python programs: because each
module file is a self-contained namespace, files must explicitly import other files
in order to use their names
part 2:
built core data types:
Number,Strings,Lists,Dictionaries,tuples,Files,Sets,Booleans,tupes,Nones,Program unit types(functions,modules,classes),implementation-related types(compiled code,stack tracebacks)
Numeric types include:
- integer and floating-point object
- complex number object
- decimal
- fraction
- sets
- booleans
